Haskell implementation of Scheme interpreter from Abelson and Sussman's SICP.

Back in 200x, I ran a study group for the classic comp sci text, "Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs" by Abelson and Sussman. The book's website, including the full text, is at
[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).

Over the course of the book, the authors build a Scheme interpreter in Scheme from first principles.
As added fun for the study group, I built the interpreter in Haskell instead of Scheme using the same 
principles. The result is what you're looking at now.
